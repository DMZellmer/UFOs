# THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE


## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to provide additional filter criteria for users to refine their search into what is 'really out there'. In addition to the date of the sighting, the user is now able to search by city, state, country, and even the shape of the observed phenomena. 


## Results

The new design of the website allows for increased search filtering by adding four additional search parameters:

1. ### City

You can choose to search for UFO sightings by city (due to the database file to be queried, be sure to type the city name in all lowercase letters.)

2. ### State

You can also choose to filter your search for the Truth by your USA state of interest.

3. ### Country

Unfortunately, the dataset only contains UFO sightings from the United States of America. Since this filter only has one option ("us"), we would suggest pairing it with the filter for date time. 

4. ### Shape

Users can also search for sightings by the general shape of the flying object. In this database, light is also considered a type of shape.

## Summary

The biggest drawback of this webpage is the limited size of it's filterable dataset. There is only one single month of recorded sightings, rendering this list a fraction, a snapshot, of the total number of UFO sightings reported in the USA, not to mention any other country on Earth. Therefore, we recommend two things immediately:
1. Massively increase the amount of dates UFO sightings are held in the database. One month of one year is simply not enough time, although it does underscore the prevelance of UFO sightings in the USA.
2. Expand the sightings data to include more countries than the USA. This will give Truth_Seekers a more complete picture of the Truth on extraterrestrials.
